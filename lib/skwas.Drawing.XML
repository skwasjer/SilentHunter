For Version 2.0 of the TGA File Format, this number should be set to 495. If the number found in this field is not 495, then the file will be assumed to be of a version other than 2.0. If it ever becomes necessary to alter this number, the change will be controlled by Truevision, and will be accompanied by a revision to the TGA File Format with an accompanying change in the version number.

            This field is an ASCII field of 41 bytes where the last byte must be a null (binary zero). This gives a total of 40 ASCII characters for the name. If the field is used, it should contain the name of the person who created the image(author). If the field is not used, you may fill it with nulls or a series of blanks (spaces) terminated by a null. The 41st byte must always be a null.

            <summary>
            This is an ASCII field consisting of 324 bytes which are organized as four lines of 80 characters, each followed by a null terminator. This field is provided, in addition to the original IMAGE ID field (in the original TGA format), because it was determined that a few developers had used the IMAGE ID field for their own purposes. This field gives the developer four lines of 80 characters each, to use as an Author Comment area. Each line is fixed to 81 bytes which makes access to the four lines easy. Each line must be terminated by a null. If you do not use all 80 available characters in the line, place the null after the last character and blank or null fill the rest of the line. The 81st byte of each of the four lines must be null.

            <summary>
            This field is an ASCII field of 41 bytes where the last byte must be a binary zero. This gives a total of 40 ASCII characters for the job name or the ID. If the field is used, it should contain a name or id tag which refers to the job with which the image was associated. This allows production companies (and others) to tie images with jobs by using this field as a job name (i.e., CITY BANK) or job id number (i.e., CITY023). If the field is not used, you may fill it with a null terminated series of blanks (spaces) or nulls. In any case, the 41st byte must be a null.

            This field is an ASCII field of 41 bytes where the last byte must be a binary zero (null). This gives a total of 40 ASCII characters for the Software ID. The purpose of this field is to allow software to determine and record with what program a particular image was created. If the field is not used, you may fill it with a null terminated series of blanks (spaces) or nulls. The 41st byte must always be a null.

        <member name="F:skwas.Drawing.TgaImage.TGA_EXTENSION.softwareVersionNumber">
            <summary>
            This field consists of two sub-fields, a SHORT and an ASCII BYTE. The purpose of this field is to define the version of software defined by the "Software ID" field above. The SHORT contains the version number as a binary integer times 100. Therefore, software version 4.17 would be the integer value 417. This allows for two decimal positions of sub-version. The ASCII BYTE supports developers who also tag a release letter to the end. For example, if the version number is 1.17b, then the SHORT would contain 117. and the ASCII BYTE would contain "b". The organization is as follows:
            		SHORT (Bytes 0 - 1): Version Number * 100
            		BYTE (Byte 2): Version Letter
            If you do not use this field, set the SHORT to binary zero, and the BYTE to a space (" ").

        <member name="F:skwas.Drawing.TgaImage.TGA_EXTENSION.keyColor">
            <summary>
            This field contains a long value which is the key color in effect at the time the image is saved. The format is in A:R:G:B where ‘A’ (most significant byte) is the alpha channel key color (if you don’t have an alpha channel in your application, keep this byte zero [0]).
            The Key Color can be thought of as the ‘background color’ or ‘transparent color’. This is the color of the ‘non image’ area of the screen, and the same color that the screen would be cleared to if erased in the application. If you don’t use this field, set it to all zeros (0). Setting the field to all zeros is the same as selecting a key color of black.
            A good example of a key color is the ‘transparent color’ used in TIPSª for WINDOW loading/saving.
